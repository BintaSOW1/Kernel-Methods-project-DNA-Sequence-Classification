# Kernel-Methods-project-DNA-Sequence-Classification

The goal of this data challenge is to use kernel methods for a data classification task on DNA sequence data. We want to predict whether a DNA sequence is binding site to a specific transcription factor. For the training, we are giving 3 datasets of 2000 sequences each and the idea is to use the models designed to make predictions on three other datasets of 1000 sequences each, the predictions obtained will then be combined to have one prediction. Our best model was obtained using multiple Kernel mistmatch and gave us a public score of 68.13% and private score of 66.46%
